# iOS
If you want to develop react-native application in iOS platform, you have to follow these instructions.
> Note: If you want to develop iOS application, you need a MacOS device.

## Installing dependencies

You will need Node, Watchman, the React Native command line interface, and Xcode.

While you can use any editor of your choice to develop your app, you will need to install Xcode in order to set up the necessary tooling to build your React Native app for iOS.

### Node, Watchman, JDK

We recommend installing Node, Watchman, and JDK using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). Run the following commands in a Terminal after installing Homebrew:

```
brew install yarn
brew install node
brew install watchman
brew tap AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk
brew cask install adoptopenjdk8
```

If you have already installed Node on your system, make sure it is Node 8.3 or newer.

[Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman) is a tool by Facebook for watching changes in the filesystem. It is highly recommended you install it for better performance.

If you have already installed JDK on your system, make sure it is JDK 8 or newer.

### The React Native CLI

Node comes with npm, which lets you install the React Native command line interface.

Run the following command in a Command Prompt or shell:

```powershell
npm install -g react-native-cli
```

> If you get an error like `Cannot find module 'npmlog'`, try installing npm directly: `curl -0 -L https://npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo sh`.

### Xcode

The easiest way to install Xcode is via the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12). Installing Xcode will also install the iOS Simulator and all the necessary tools to build your iOS app.

If you have already installed Xcode on your system, make sure it is version 9.4 or newer.

#### Command Line Tools

You will also need to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. Open Xcode, then choose "Preferences..." from the Xcode menu. Go to the Locations panel and install the tools by selecting the most recent version in the Command Line Tools dropdown.

### Java Development Kit

React Native requires version 8 of the Java SE Development Kit (JDK). You may download and install [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net) from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) or your system packager. You may also [Download and install Oracle JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) if desired.


## Running your React Native application

Run `react-native run-ios` inside your React Native project folder:

```
cd AwesomeProject
react-native run-ios
```

You should see your new app running in the iOS Simulator shortly.

`react-native run-ios` is just one way to run your app. You can also run it directly from within Xcode.

> If you can't get this to work, see the [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#content) page.

### Running on a device

The above command will automatically run your app on the iOS Simulator by default. If you want to run the app on an actual physical iOS device, please follow the instructions [here](running-on-device.md).

### Modifying your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

<block class="native mac ios" />

- Open `App.js` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
- Hit `âŒ˜R` in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

### That's it!

Congratulations! You've successfully run and modified your first React Native app.
