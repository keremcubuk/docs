## Abstract
If you want to develop react-native application in Android platform, you have to follow these instructions.

## Installing dependencies
You will need Node, Watchman, the React Native command line interface, a JDK, and Android Studio.

While you can use any editor of your choice to develop your app, you will need to install Android Studio in order to set up the necessary tooling to build your React Native app for Android.

### Node, Watchman, JDK

We recommend installing Node, Watchman, and JDK using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). Run the following commands in a Terminal after installing Homebrew:

```
brew install yarn
brew install node
brew install watchman
brew tap AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk
brew cask install adoptopenjdk8
```

If you have already installed Node on your system, make sure it is Node 8.3 or newer.

[Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman) is a tool by Facebook for watching changes in the filesystem. It is highly recommended you install it for better performance.

If you have already installed JDK on your system, make sure it is JDK 8 or newer.

### Android development environment

Setting up your development environment can be somewhat tedious if you're new to Android development. If you're already familiar with Android development, there are a few things you may need to configure. In either case, please make sure to carefully follow the next few steps.


#### 1. Install Android Studio

[Download and install Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html). Choose a "Custom" setup when prompted to select an installation type. Make sure the boxes next to all of the following are checked:

- `Android SDK`
- `Android SDK Platform`
- `Performance (Intel ® HAXM)` ([See here for AMD](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/07/android-emulator-amd-processor-hyper-v.html))
- `Android Virtual Device`

Then, click "Next" to install all of these components.

> If the checkboxes are grayed out, you will have a chance to install these components later on.

Once setup has finalized and you're presented with the Welcome screen, proceed to the next step.

<h4>2. Install the Android SDK</h4>

Android Studio installs the latest Android SDK by default. Building a React Native app with native code, however, requires the `Android 9 (Pie)` SDK in particular. Additional Android SDKs can be installed through the SDK Manager in Android Studio.

The SDK Manager can be accessed from the "Welcome to Android Studio" screen. Click on "Configure", then select "SDK Manager".

> The SDK Manager can also be found within the Android Studio "Preferences" dialog, under **Appearance & Behavior** → **System Settings** → **Android SDK**.

Select the "SDK Platforms" tab from within the SDK Manager, then check the box next to "Show Package Details" in the bottom right corner. Look for and expand the `Android 9 (Pie)` entry, then make sure the following items are checked:

- `Android SDK Platform 28`
- `Intel x86 Atom_64 System Image` or `Google APIs Intel x86 Atom System Image`

Next, select the "SDK Tools" tab and check the box next to "Show Package Details" here as well. Look for and expand the "Android SDK Build-Tools" entry, then make sure that `28.0.3` is selected.

Finally, click "Apply" to download and install the Android SDK and related build tools.

#### 3. Configure the ANDROID_HOME environment variable

The React Native tools require some environment variables to be set up in order to build apps with native code.

Add the following lines to your `$HOME/.bash_profile` or `$HOME/.bashrc` config file:

```
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```

<block class="native mac linux android" />

> `.bash_profile` is specific to `bash`. If you're using another shell, you will need to edit the appropriate shell-specific config file.

Type `source $HOME/.bash_profile` to load the config into your current shell. Verify that ANDROID_HOME has been added to your path by running `echo $PATH`.

> Please make sure you use the correct Android SDK path. You can find the actual location of the SDK in the Android Studio "Preferences" dialog, under **Appearance & Behavior** → **System Settings** → **Android SDK**.

## Preparing the Android device

You will need an Android device to run your React Native Android app. This can be either a physical Android device, or more commonly, you can use an Android Virtual Device which allows you to emulate an Android device on your computer.

Either way, you will need to prepare the device to run Android apps for development.

### Using a physical device

If you have a physical Android device, you can use it for development in place of an AVD by plugging it in to your computer using a USB cable and following the instructions [here](running-on-device.md).

### Using a virtual device

If you use Android Studio to open `./AwesomeProject/android`, you can see the list of available Android Virtual Devices (AVDs) by opening the "AVD Manager" from within Android Studio. Look for an icon that looks like this:

![Android Studio AVD Manager](/assets/images/GettingStartedAndroidStudioAVD.png)

If you have just installed Android Studio, you will likely need to [create a new AVD](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds.html). Select "Create Virtual Device...", then pick any Phone from the list and click "Next", then select the **Pie** API Level 28 image.

> If you don't have HAXM installed, follow [these instructions](https://github.com/intel/haxm/wiki/Installation-Instructions-on-macOS) to set it up, then go back to the AVD Manager.

Click "Next" then "Finish" to create your AVD. At this point you should be able to click on the green triangle button next to your AVD to launch it, then proceed to the next step.

## Running your React Native application

Run `react-native run-android` inside your React Native project folder:

```
cd AwesomeProject
react-native run-android
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your Android emulator shortly.

`react-native run-android` is just one way to run your app - you can also run it directly from within Android Studio.

> If you can't get this to work, see the [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#content) page.

### Modifying your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

- Open `App.js` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
- Press the `R` key twice or select `Reload` from the Developer Menu (`⌘M`) to see your changes!

### That's it!

Congratulations! You've successfully run and modified your first React Native app.
